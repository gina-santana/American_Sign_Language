## Background:

Modern American Sign Language (ASL) is a visual language that was developed in 1817 and is used as a visual means of communicating ideas and concepts. It is estimated by the National Center for Health Statistics that there are 28 million Americans living with some degree of hearing loss. Of the 28 million, there is an estimated 2 million Americans who are classified as deaf meaning they are unable to hear everyday sounds/speech even with hearing aids. 10% of the 2 million Americans were born deaf with the remaining 90% developing it later in life.
